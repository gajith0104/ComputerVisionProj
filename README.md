## HandWrittenDigits project

### Foreword:
I have created and pruned a Convolutional Neural Network to learn the importance of the various layers/steps. With each 
 commit, you can see how I have been learning and adding layers.

### GIST:
The CNN is trained using MINST random sets of digits and classifications. I plan on using a 2 layers implementation to 
decipher various low level features and high level features. Finally, to test it, I will use a different random set of 
MINST test data and my own digits handwriting to verify.
